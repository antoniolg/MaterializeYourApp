# Materialize Your App

This app was the base example for a talk I did at [MaterialFest](http://materialfest.com/) on January 31st, 2015.

After that, I've used this example in some other articles:

- [Materialize your App](http://antonioleiva.com/materialize-app/)
- [Design Support Library (I): Navigation View](http://antonioleiva.com/navigation-view/)
- [Design Support Library (II): Floating Action Button](http://antonioleiva.com/floating-action-button/)
- [Design Support Library (III): Coordinator Layout](http://antonioleiva.com/coordinator-layout/)
- [Design Support Library (IV): Collapsing Toolbar Layout](http://antonioleiva.com/collapsing-toolbar-layout/)
- [Layout animations on RecyclerView](http://antonioleiva.com/layout-animations-on-recyclerview/)
